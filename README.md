# Data Sructure and Algorithm Review

This repo is a collection of basic data structure and algorithm implementations. Its creation is intended to be my review of core computer science concepts. It is currently only implemented in Javascript, but I would like to take a second pass in another branch using Golang.

## Contents

1. [Memoization](/memoization)
2. [Trees](/trees)

## Usage

Node.js is required to run Javascript files in the terminal

You can clone the repo and run `npm install` to add Jest, which is used to run the tests. Once setup you can run any file directly to see it run with some related output, or just run the tests.

`node ./path/to/file.js`

## Tests

There are tests included for each algorithm to ensure the optimizations they provide are correctly implemented. For example in `fibonacci.test.js` there is a test checking how many times the function calls itself to ensure it properly uses memoization to not make the same calculation multiple times.

`npm run test`
